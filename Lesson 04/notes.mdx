1. We added the Posts model in the models.py file(in the posts app dir)

2. To make all the changes visible, we ran the command - py manage.py makemigrations.
    and this is the result- 
        {/* 
            py manage.py makemigrations
            Migrations for 'posts':
            posts\migrations\0001_initial.py
                + Create model Posts
            (.venv)  
        */}
    We can see the result in the migrations folder - 0001_intial.py

3. Apply the migrations by sending the migrate command - py manage.py migrate
